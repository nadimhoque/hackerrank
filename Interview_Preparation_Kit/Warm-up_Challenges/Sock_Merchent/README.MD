#Sock Merchant

##__Methodology__

###Dictionary; Key-Value Pair

My approach with this method will be to do the following:

1. Create an empty dictionary. The key will be the sock type and the value will the the number of socks so far.
2. Check if the sock is in the dictionary. If it is not then I will add the sock to the dictionary and set the value to 1.
3. If the sock does exist add 1 to the counter. If the updated value is 2 I will add one to the count and zero out the value.

###Array

The method will do the following

1. At the current location check if the position+1 is the same, if not then move on, else add 1 to the counter
