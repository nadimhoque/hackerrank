#Sock Merchant

__Methodology__

I think I will implement a dictionary (key-value pair). The key in this case will be the sock type and the value will the number of them. If the key/sock does not exist I will add it to the list and obviously the value will be set to one. Once the value is two then I will set the value to zero and add 1 to counter
